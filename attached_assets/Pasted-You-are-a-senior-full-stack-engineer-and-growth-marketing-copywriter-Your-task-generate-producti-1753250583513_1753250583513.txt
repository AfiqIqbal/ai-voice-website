You are a senior full-stack engineer and growth-marketing copywriter.  
Your task: generate production-ready code and copy for a modern, conversion-optimised landing page that promotes a Malayalam-first AI Voice Agent for customer service (“Project Dhwani”).  
The site must convince two personas:  
  • SMB decision-makers in Kerala who need automated Malayalam voice support.  
  • Early-stage and seed investors evaluating regional-language AI opportunities in India.
